Every fortnight when I make my mail flight up to Ambler Bay, I look forward to visiting old Hildie.
This trip, though, Hildie was so overwrought she forgot her manners and pounced on the mail packet without offering me a drink. She found the envelope from the photo lab in Anchorage and ripped it open.
The picture showed a body lying in the snow, beyond the chain-link fence that the oil company had erected around its drilling site.
The woman was lying between two great pines in the middle of an expanse of fresh snow. There were no tracks and no snow on the woman. It was almost as if she had fallen from the sky.
The arrival of the oil company had also brought eco-warriors up from Seattle. The activists were intent on scaling the trees around the drilling site and this woman was likely one of them, a protester who had fallen from her perch.
Hildie is in her 70s. When she saw the body, she went home to radio for help. Unfortunately, she was out of methanol and her generator was dry, so the radio wouldn't work. She then locked up her dog, Betsy, and drove to the sheriff's office in Ambler, taking the photo on the way. 
By the time the sheriff and Hildie returned to the site, the body was gone and a fresh fall of snow left no traces as to how she might have disappeared. With no body, there was no mystery. Now I had seen Hildie's photographs, I knew this was impossible. Dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt, the woman would have died of hypothermia in half an hour.
"Do you recognise her?"
"No, I don't think so."
Hildie had lived the simple life in Ambler for more than 40 years and she had no intention of selling up. She was even doing her bit for the protesters, allowing them to set up a base camp on her land. When I saw their camp on my last trip, I thought, that makes sense of the letters Hildie had been receiving from Seattle over the past year. She and the eco-warriors may have been in cahoots but Hildie was in a minority of one around Ambler. Everyone else would have welcomed an offer from the oil company - but only Hildie owned land in the right vicinity.
After I left, I recognised one of the protesters, a youngster named Ben Abbott.
"Hey man! I was just heading to the compound fence."
In Hildie's photograph, the fence had been in poor shape, with holes cut out and a few strands of colourful nylon thread snagged on the wire where a protester must have snuck through. I should tell Ben that it wouldn't be so easy for him to get there...
Ben thanked me for the information. I wished him good luck, and worried that we might see another body on the ground before springtime.
Ben laughed, telling me that Betsy had made the trip worthwhile. As Hildie always said, Betsy was the smartest dog in the world.
Once the sheriff saw Hildie's picture, he wasted no time calling in Frank Tanner, the watchman for the oil company. It wasn't the sheriff's style to move fast, but what I didn't know until I inveigled my way into his office was that he already had a body. 
The dead woman had been found in a ravine on the far side of Ambler, about 30 miles from the drilling site, which was no distance in such a spread-out community. There was no doubt that this was the woman in Hildie's photograph: she was wearing the same dark jeans and sweats. 
"This has to be embarrassing, Frank - a dead woman on your shift."
I asked the sheriff if he believed Tanner's story. The sheriff shrugged, but said once he got the forensic report, he would call the witnesses together and figure out the story.
Things move slowly in Ambler. I flew the woman's body down to Anchorage for the autopsy and I was back by the time the sheriff got the results. 
Tanner was still in the sheriff's cell but the forensic report went some way to supporting his story... 
the woman had died of hypothermia, not trauma. 
She was about 40 years old and part Yupik, the native tribe in those parts. The Yupik claimed no one from their tribe was missing. She may have been the illegitimate daughter of one of the old boys.
The sheriff had four possible witnesses. Frank Tanner, of course. Ben Abbott and the other eco-warrior, his girlfriend, Flossie Jones. And finally, old Hildie. 
Hildie was more excited by the tail end of a rope, visible in one of the trees. 
Flossie and Ben had claimed they had made a start scaling a tree before the weather drove them back to camp. 
Hildie: "I saw Frank Tanner cutting down the ropes the next day."
Tanner: "She's lying! I didn't do that." But the photograph clearly showed that Tanner was the liar.
Ben: "Did the woman show signs of having fallen from a height?"
Sheriff: "Nothing is conclusive: she had cuts and bruises but no broken bones."
Hildie: "The snow seems deep enough to have cushioned a fall."
Flossie: "Could she have gotten her injuries from falling through the brambles into the ravine where she had been found?" 
Sheriff: "How did you know about the brambles?" 
Flossie: "I'd gone along to look at the crime scene after the news came out."
The sheriff seemed to accept this. At any rate, he told us that the postmortem proved the woman was alive when she got her cuts and grazes and dead before she entered the ravine. What else could he tell us? The dead woman had sailed up from Seattle on a fishing boat.
Ben and Flossie were adamant they had never seen her before, but the sheriff said she fitted the eco-warrior profile: she had arrests for drink, drugs and vagrancy. This time, he got a reaction ... from Hildie. 
Hildie: "You ought to be ashamed of yourself, casting aspersions on two good kids!."
Once the sheriff had calmed everyone down, he admitted that the crew of the fishing boat reported that the dead woman sounded more like a prospector than a protester. The crewmen wrote her off as a fantasist, a damaged woman who was getting on in life and getting desperate.
I said, "However she died, she must have been drunk, stumbling around in the snow or falling out of trees."
"I don't know if she was drunk," the sheriff replied. "I can tell you she was blind. And that's the problem. I think we've got a murder inquiry on our hands."
I nodded sadly. "I think so too, sheriff."
Hildie's illegitimate daughter came to persuade Hildie to sell her property to the oil company. Whether out of fear or malice, Hildie gave her daughter methanol rather than moonshine, which destroys the optic nerve. Blinded, the woman stumbled into the snow and, at the centre of the drilling site, covered herself with her ski jacket before dying of hypothermia. Hildie's dog took the jacket from the dying woman and dragged it to Hildie, who was waiting at the fence. With no snow on her body, it appeared the woman had fallen from the trees. This is what Frank Tanner thought when he disposed of her body, spoiling Hildie's plan to embarrass the oil company and cover up her murder.
